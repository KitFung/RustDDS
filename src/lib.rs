//! A pure Rust implementation of Data Distribution Service (DDS).
//!
//! DDS is an object-oriented API [specified](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/2.3) by
//! the Object Management Group.
//!
//! DDS communicates over the network using the [RTPS](https://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/2.3)
//! protocol, which by default runs over UDP/IP.
//!
//! This implementation does not attempt to make an accurate implementation of the DDS object API,
//! as it would be quite unnatural to use in Rust as such. However, we aim for functional compatibility,
//! while at the same time using Rust techniques and conventions.
//!
//! Additionally, there is a [ROS2](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/) interface, that is simpler to use than DDS
//! when communicating to ROS2 components.
